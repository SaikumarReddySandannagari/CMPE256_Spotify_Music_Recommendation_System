# Abstract

In present scenario, Music has become an important media for every individual. With the wide availability of internet, Music applications are developing in a wide range. Applications like Spotify, Sound-cloud, Amazon-Music, Apple-Music made music availability easy. People are using these at a great deal. In every music application, recommendations of songs related to users interests plays a vital role in users selection of listening to songs. As a part of my project, I built a recommendation system for music using spotify data based on user searches which will help users to pick songs of his interest easily.

# Workflow

Data is collected from Million Playlist Dataset provided by Spotify. This data is cleaned by removing duplicates and Null values and then used bag of words model to predict top n recommendations for the given track
